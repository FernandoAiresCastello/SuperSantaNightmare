Things to do:

- Player rotation along with scene
	Player sprite has sprite billboard script which makes it always face the camera, and as a consequence the rotation is locked in all axes (it never rotates around any axis). This is wrong behavior. It should not rotate in the Y-axis, but it must rotate in the X-axis.

- Player hopping when moving down
	Supposedly has to do with the fact that the rotation of the player is being locked, since this does not occur when the billboard script is deactivated.
	
- Voxel alignment
	Currently voxels are being manually aligned to each other. Find some tool or script to allow for automatic snapping of voxels into a 3d grid.

- Animated voxel textures
	Implement animation of voxel textures (e.g. water)
